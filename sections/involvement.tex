\section{Rationale for Application}
% the world has loads of information 
% biomedical engineering is a rapidly growing and reaching into the public 
%% sectors' interests
% information needs explaining
% I have a vocation as an educator
There are various reasons why involvement in this project would be beneficial. 
Apart from the obvious personal development benefits, 
Participating in this project would be a chance to give something back to 
the community in a tangible way. 
This new project is an opportunity for the new \url{physicsworld.com} 
site to attract a broader audience, perhaps one that is not
necessarily scientifically literate, but that have the curiosity to find out 
about relevant topics in scientific fields. Playing a part in this project would
provide the opportunity to perform that service: give broader sectors of the
population a window to real scientific achievements, while remaining challenging
enough to write appealing content for scientists' interests. 
\medskip\\In general, the generation, reception and sharing of information 
about the world is growing. Scientific research in many fields is no longer a 
far fetched entity, but its relevant topics are also becoming relevant to the 
public domain. The handling of information and the accurate presentation of
scientific facts to the public has always been of great importance, however
that importance has increased in a world where content creation is as easily 
achievable as content reception. The implications of a curious and well informed 
audience range from basic social interactions to potential public policies. 
Thus, a platform that provides a broad audience with the scientific context of 
the latest achievements, would be most beneficial, and participating in it would 
be most rewarding.\medskip\\ The field of biomedical engineering has become 
increasingly relevant, due to advances in many fields: a clear example is in
immunohistochemistry, which combines many disciplines like medicine, biology,
physics, chemistry and computer science; all of which have been evolving at 
growing rates. Biomedical engineering's advancements pose important questions 
that require ethical approval from governments, such as genetic manipulation
, 
and the future of the field involves even bigger questions, like human 
enhancement.
