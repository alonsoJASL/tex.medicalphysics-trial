\section{Rationale for Application}
% the world has loads of information 
% biomedical engineering is a rapidly growing and reaching into the public 
%% sectors' interests
% information needs explaining
% I have a vocation as an educator
There are various reasons why I would like to be involved in this project. Apart
from the (in my opinion) obvious personal development benefits, I believe this 
would be a chance for me to give something back to the community in a tangible 
way. I see this project as a way for the new \url{physicsworld.com} site to 
be launched as an 
opportunity to attract a broader audience, perhaps one that is not necessarily
scientifically literate, but that have the curiosity to find out about relevant
topics in the field. This would then give me the opportunity to perform that 
service: give broader sectors of the population a window to real scientific 
achievements, while challenging myself to write to my own peers' interests. 
\medskip\\In general, the generation, reception and sharing of information about the world
is growing. Scientific research in many fields is no longer a far fetched entity, 
but its relevant topics are becoming relevant to public domain.
